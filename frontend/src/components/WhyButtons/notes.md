### buttons, iterations, etc 

eventually i plan to have more than one option, but atm i am testing the buttons, and the iterations of prompt/response with different models 

(i like llama3, but that's mostly because it's provding more intersting text at this stage, and while working on this see a lot of generated text )

i also plan to output the various responses, and then run analysis on them
